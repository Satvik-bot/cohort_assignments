High level understanding and examples:
### Async 
Multiple tasks at once - side by side.

#### 1. setTimeout

```
function doSomething() {
	let a=1
	for(let i=0; i<10000; i++) {
		a++;
	}
	console.log(a);
}

setTimeout(doSomething, 1000);
console.log('Hello')
```


Output
`Hello
`10001

Other examples-
2. fs.readFile - to read a file from your filesystem
3. Fetch - to fetch some data from an API endpoint

----
### Sync
Tasks one at a time

### syncSleep()

```
function syncSleep() {
	let a=1
	for(let i=0; i<10000; i++) {
		a++;
	}
	console.log(a);
}
console.log('Hello')
```

Forces the operation to take place before printing 'Hello'

Output- 
`10001`
`Hello`



**Important Note:**
In JS, if a thread is busy somewhere, and on the other hand a async callback has resolved, the thread will remain busy until the thread becomes idle.


Example - 
```
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("a.txt", "utf-8", function (err, data) {
  console.log(data);
});

console.log("hi here");
let a = 0;
// takes very long, longer the file read
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  a++;
}

console.log("hi there 2");;

```

Output - 

```
hi here
hi there 2
hi from a.txt
```


# Promises

![[Pasted image 20240106200241.png]]

- Just syntactical sugar
- Just a more readable way to write async functions


```
var p = new Promise( function pr(resolve,reject){
	// ..
} );
```


The `Promise(..)` constructor takes a single function (`pr(..)`), which is called immediately and receives two control functions as arguments, usually named `resolve(..)` and `reject(..)`. They are used as:

- If you call `reject(..)`, the promise is rejected, and if any value is passed to `reject(..)`, it is set as the reason for rejection.
- If you call `resolve(..)` with no value, or any non-promise value, the promise is fulfilled.
- If you call `resolve(..)` and pass another promise, this promise simply adopts the state -- whether immediate or eventual -- of the passed promise (either fulfillment or rejection).
