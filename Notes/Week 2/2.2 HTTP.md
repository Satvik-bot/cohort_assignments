## <font style="color:green">What is Javascript </font>
- Is a scripting language that conforms to ECMAScript specification
- JS has additional features like DOM manipulation not defined by ECMAScript
### Compiler
There is no unified compiler for JS.
1. V8 - Chromium/Chrome - C/C++ https://github.com/v8/v8 
2. SpiderMonkey - Firefox - C + Rust https://spidermonkey.dev/

## <font style="color:green">What is Node.js</font>
- It is a RUNTIME and NOT a language! (Interview Question)
## <font style="color:green">What is Bun</font>
- Written in Zig

#Question What can you do with Node.js?
#Answer:
1. Create clis (command line interface)
2. Create a video player
3. Create a game
4. Create an <font style="color:green">HTTP Server</font> (95% of the time)

#Question What is HTTP Server?
#Answer:
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate
- Most common way for the frontend to talk to its backend
- WebRTC is a protocol for video communication

## Things Client need to worry about - 
```
1. Protocol - HTTP/HTTPS
2. Address(URL/Port/IP)
3. Route
4. Headers, Body, Query Params
5. Method
```
## Things Server need to worry about - 
```
1. Response headers
2. Response Body
3. Status codes

**Header** - Cookie: some sort of authentication (login/logout)
**Route** - What exactly is happening in the website, where are you located.
**Body** - Sending arguments, example - a query in chatgpt
**Method** - What do you want to do? Get, Post, Put, Delete
```

#Question What happens when you go to google.com ?
#Answer: Series of events take place:
```
1. Browser parse the URL
2. Does a DNS lookup (converts google.com to an IP)
3. Establishes a connection to the IP (does handshake...)
```

#Question What is DNS resolution?
#Answer : URLs are just like contacts in your phone
In the end, they all map to an IP
If you ever buy a URL of your own, you will need to point it to the IP of your server.

## Status Codes
```
1. 403 - Auth issue
2. 404 - Page/Route not found 
3. 411 - Inputs are incorrect
4. 500 - Internal Server error -> Bug in BE
5. 200 - OK
```
